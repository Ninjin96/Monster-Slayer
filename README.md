# Monster-Slayer
Hi there everyone and future me reading this! In this project I will present a turn-based game that I've created using the frontend framework Vue.js.
This is the first time I worked with a frontend framework and I have to say it's super useful!

## Preview:

As this is a frontend project, it is hosted on GitHub: https://ninjin96.github.io/Monster-Slayer/.

Alternatively, you can download the code and open the HTML file.

## How to play?
Well the game is quite self-explanatory. The goal is to defeat the monster by choosing the correct options provided. Good luck!
